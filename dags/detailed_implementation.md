## **Design Document: Scaling the Enrichment AML Pipeline for Petabyte-Level Data Processing**

### **1. Introduction**

The **Enrichment AML Pipeline** is a PySpark-based batch processing system designed to detect Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and fraud activities across large volumes of financial data. Its core responsibilities include:

- **Ingesting** upstream datasets (e.g., transactions, customer profiles, compliance rules).  
- **Enriching** data through joins and custom logic (e.g., suspicion scoring).  
- **Aggregating** and producing final outputs for downstream analysis.

As data volumes scale into the **petabyte range**, the current implementation reveals performance bottlenecks and shortcomings in scalability. This design document proposes a systematic strategy to address these challenges, focusing on ingestion, storage, join/transformations, UDF usage, aggregation, and Spark configurations. By applying these optimizations and best practices, the pipeline can reliably handle petabyte-scale data.

---

### **2. Objectives**

1. **Identify Key Bottlenecks**: Analyze where the pipeline slows down or uses resources inefficiently.  
2. **Recommend Optimizations**: Provide detailed, actionable improvements for ingestion, joins, transformations, and cluster configuration.  
3. **Ensure Petabyte-Scale Readiness**: Enable the pipeline to process extremely large datasets (petabytes) within acceptable SLAs.  
4. **Maintain Resource Efficiency**: Balance performance gains with responsible resource usage (e.g., compute and memory).  

These objectives aim to make the pipeline both robust and cost-effective at large scale.

---

### **3. Current Implementation Overview**

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   - Reads Parquet files stored in **local directories** (mimicking S3 buckets).  
   - Utilizes a basic file-based approach with minimal partitioning.

2. **Data Joins**  
   - Performs multiple **left joins** between transaction data and supporting reference datasets:  
     - **Customer Profiles** (KYC, personal data)  
     - **Accounts** (bank accounts, credit cards)  
     - **Merchants** (business profiles)  
     - **Compliance Rules** (watchlists, regulatory flags)

3. **Enrichment**  
   - Applies **Python UDFs** to compute suspicion scores and rule hits.  
   - Logic resides in UDFs that examine transaction attributes (amount, location, merchant type, etc.).

4. **Aggregation**  
   - Groups enriched data by entity (e.g., customer ID) to produce **suspicion indices** or other aggregated metrics.

5. **Output**  
   - Writes the final enriched results back to disk as **Parquet files** for downstream analytics.

6. **Spark Cluster Configuration**  
   - Currently limited to **2 executors**, **2GB memory each**, and **4 shuffle partitions**.  
   - This setup quickly becomes a bottleneck beyond small-scale data volumes.

---

### **4. Performance Bottlenecks**

With petabyte-scale data, the following issues become critical:

1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**  
   - Reading from local disk does not scale for high-throughput workloads.  
   - Insufficient partitioning leads to uneven data distribution and inefficient parallelism.

2. **Data Joins and Transformations**  
   - Multiple large joins cause significant **shuffle** overhead (network I/O, disk writes).  
   - Data skew (when one join key is disproportionately large) can overwhelm certain executors.

3. **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**  
   - **Python UDFs** add serialization and deserialization overhead (between JVM and Python workers).  
   - Complex business logic implemented in Python can degrade performance compared to native Spark SQL.

4. **Aggregation and Grouping**  
   - Large-scale **groupBy** or **reduceByKey** actions trigger expensive shuffles, requiring significant memory and time.  
   - Potential for **out-of-memory** (OOM) errors if aggregation is not carefully designed or if the cluster is under-resourced.

5. **Schema Design**  
   - Reliance on a **star schema** with frequent joins can be costly at scale.  
   - High cardinality dimensions or complex relationships intensify join complexity.

6. **Spark Configuration**  
   - Few executors and minimal memory severely limit concurrency.  
   - **spark.sql.shuffle.partitions** too small for large workloads, causing straggling tasks and overhead.

### **5. Proposed Optimizations**

Below are detailed strategies to address bottlenecks and scale the pipeline effectively.

---

#### **5.1 Optimize Data Ingestion and Storage**

1. **Transition to Distributed Storage**  
   - Replace local file reads with **HDFS** or **cloud storage** (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Data Lake Storage).  
   - These systems provide **horizontal scalability** and parallel data access.

2. **Partitioning Strategies**  
   - Partition data on relevant dimensions (date, region, transaction ID).  
   - This **partitions** large datasets into smaller, more manageable chunks, improving parallel read performance and enabling selective queries.

3. **Advanced Table Formats**  
   - Adopt **Delta Lake** or **Apache Iceberg** for ACID transactions, data versioning, and efficient metadata management.  
   - Provide **time-travel** capabilities, schema evolution, and advanced optimizations (e.g., data skipping).

**Benefit**: Faster I/O, efficient parallel access, and improved data organization for massive datasets.

---

#### **5.2 Improve Data Joins and Transformations**

1. **Broadcast Joins**  
   - For smaller reference tables (e.g., compliance rules, watchlists), use **broadcast joins** (`broadcast()` hint).  
   - Eliminates shuffle by sending small reference data to each executor.

2. **Bucketing and Sorting**  
   - **Bucket** large fact tables on common join keys (e.g., customer_id) to reduce the amount of data shuffled during joins.  
   - **Sort** data within buckets to enable efficient merge-like joins.

3. **Denormalization**  
   - **Pre-join** commonly used datasets to reduce repeated join operations.  
   - E.g., merge customer and account data into a single reference dataset if they are always joined together.

4. **Data Skew Handling**  
   - Identify skewed keys (e.g., accounts with excessive transactions) and apply **salting** or skew hints to redistribute data.  
   - Avoid hotspots that slow down individual tasks.

**Benefit**: Less shuffle overhead, improved data parallelism, and more efficient use of memory and CPU.

---

#### **5.3 Replace or Optimize UDFs**

1. **Leverage Native Functions**  
   - Replace complex Python UDFs with **Spark SQL** functions like `when`, `case`, or `expr`.  
   - Built-in functions run inside the JVM, avoiding cross-language overhead.

2. **Use Pandas UDFs (Vectorized UDFs)**  
   - If custom logic is unavoidable, **Pandas UDFs** can process data in batches with Arrow-based serialization, faster than standard UDFs.  
   - This approach strikes a balance between flexibility and performance.

3. **Minimize UDF Reliance**  
   - Consolidate simple transformations into Spark’s DSL (`select`, `withColumn`, etc.).  
   - Refactor complex business logic into a combination of native operations and only use UDFs where absolutely necessary.

**Benefit**: Significant speedups by reducing Python-JVM serialization overhead and leveraging Spark’s optimized execution engine.

---

#### **5.4 Optimize Aggregation and Grouping**

1. **Approximate Aggregations**  
   - For large-group calculations where absolute precision is not critical, use **approximate** functions like `approx_count_distinct`.  
   - Speeds up queries while still providing near-accurate results.

2. **Partial Aggregation**  
   - Perform **map-side** (or partial) aggregations first, reducing the data volume before it hits the shuffle.  
   - E.g., do a local sum or count on each partition, then a final aggregate across partitions.

3. **Window Functions**  
   - Instead of a full `groupBy`, leverage **window functions** for certain calculations (e.g., rolling averages, rank, or partition-based aggregates).  
   - Can reduce the need for heavy shuffles when used correctly.

**Benefit**: Lower shuffle volumes, reduced memory usage, and faster completion of aggregation jobs.

---

#### **5.5 Re-evaluate Schema Design**

1. **Schema Alternatives**  
   - Traditional **star schemas** might be suboptimal for certain real-time or large-scale transformations.  
   - Consider **data vault** or **anchor modeling** for more flexible data relationships.

2. **Columnar Storage**  
   - Continue using **Parquet** or **ORC** for columnar compression and efficient scans.  
   - Choose compression codecs (e.g., **Snappy**, **Zstd**) that strike a good balance between CPU overhead and file size.

3. **Denormalization**  
   - Create wide, flattened datasets (when feasible) to reduce the number of joins needed at query time.  
   - Evaluate trade-offs: storage cost vs. significant runtime performance gains.

**Benefit**: Streamlined transformations, reduced join complexity, and optimized read patterns at extreme scale.

---

#### **5.6 Tune Spark Configuration**

1. **Scale Cluster Resources**  
   - Increase the number of **executors** (e.g., 100+ for petabyte loads) and memory (16GB+ each), pending the underlying infrastructure.  
   - Ensure you have enough CPU cores to handle the parallelism demanded by the data volume.

2. **Key Spark Parameters**  
   - `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`: Increase to **2000+** (or more) for massive shuffles.  
   - `spark.default.parallelism`: Match or exceed the number of executor cores for balanced parallelism.  
   - `spark.executor.memory` and `spark.driver.memory`: Adjust to prevent OOM errors.  
   - Enable **dynamic allocation** to scale executors up/down based on workload demands.

3. **Storage and Shuffle**  
   - If using on-premise or self-managed Spark, ensure fast disk (SSD) and robust network for shuffle operations.  
   - Monitor and tweak shuffle settings (e.g., `spark.shuffle.file.buffer`, `spark.shuffle.memoryFraction`) to handle large data volumes efficiently.

**Benefit**: Improved parallelism, shorter runtimes, and better resource utilization for big data workloads.

### **6. Additional Strategies for Petabyte-Scale Processing**

1. **Data Partitioning and Locality**  
   - Intelligently **partition** data by time (daily/hourly) or entity (customer/account), distributing load evenly.  
   - Optimize **data locality** by processing data on the nodes where it resides, minimizing network traffic.

2. **Caching and Persistence**  
   - **Cache** intermediate results (`df.cache()` or `persist()`) if they are reused multiple times in the pipeline.  
   - Choose the right storage level (e.g., **MEMORY_ONLY**, **MEMORY_AND_DISK**) to accommodate data size vs. memory constraints.

3. **Incremental Processing**  
   - Implement **change data capture (CDC)** or watermarking to only process newly arrived or updated data.  
   - Prevents complete reprocessing of petabytes of historical data each time the pipeline runs.

4. **Monitoring and Logging**  
   - Integrate tools like **Spark UI**, **Prometheus**, or **Ganglia** to track real-time metrics (executor usage, shuffle volume, etc.).  
   - Add detailed logging to identify hotspots, diagnose failed tasks, and continuously refine performance.

5. **Advanced Optimizations**  
   - Exploit Spark’s **Catalyst Optimizer** for automatic query plan improvements.  
   - Enable **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)** to dynamically tune shuffle partitions and join strategies at runtime.  
   - Use **Z-order indexing** or partition pruning (in Delta Lake) to reduce unnecessary data scans and speed up queries.

1. **Trade-Offs and Justifications**  
   - How to balance design complexity (e.g., advanced partitioning schemes) with maintainability.  
   - The pros and cons of denormalization vs. normalized schemas at extreme scale.

2. **Resource Management**  
   - Budgeting compute vs. memory vs. cost—especially in cloud environments where resources can quickly become expensive.  
   - Choosing between vertical scaling (bigger machines) vs. horizontal scaling (more machines).

3. **Failure Handling and Resilience**  
   - Strategies for dealing with long-running jobs that may fail partway through.  
   - Checkpointing, retry logic, idempotency, and robust error handling.

4. **Performance Monitoring**  
   - Understanding Spark metrics, shuffle details, GC overhead, and how to tune them in real-world deployments.  
   - Using logging and alerting frameworks to continuously refine performance over time.

5. **Data Governance and Security**  
   - Encryption at rest and in transit, compliance with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR).  
   - Partition filtering for data access and role-based access control at scale.

These topics often arise in lead-level interviews, requiring both theoretical knowledge and practical experience.
