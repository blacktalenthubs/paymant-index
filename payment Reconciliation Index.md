# Payment Reconciliation Data Indexing System Design Document

## Overview
- **Purpose:** Ingest, enrich, and join six upstream sources into a single indexing output for fraud dashboards, merchant metrics, and audit reporting.
- **Data Sources:** Transactions, ML Signal (fraud scores), Locations, Merchants, Users, Card (masked).
- **Enrichment:** Integrate internal policy data to enforce location-based restrictions.

## System Architecture
- **Pipelines (4 pipelines / 6 Airflow DAGs):**
  - **Data Ingestion:** Batch import from a local directory with plans to migrate to S3.
  - **Data Enrichment:** Merge upstream data with internal policy rules.
  - **Data Indexing:** Perform definitive joins and transformations to produce the final output.
  - **Data Quality:** Validate schemas and ensure data integrity.
- **Processing Mode:** All jobs run in batch mode.

## Data Storage & Performance Strategy
- **Storage:**  
  - Development uses the local file system.  
  - Production uses S3 with a columnar format such as Parquet.
- **Performance:**  
  - Partition data by date and merchant.  
  - Use indexing and clustering based on established query patterns.  
  - Leverage Spark for parallel processing.

## Data Modeling: Star Schema Design
- **Fact Table (Payment Index Fact):**  
  - Contains surrogate keys from Transactions, Merchants, Users, Locations, Cards, and ML Signals.  
  - Includes measures like transaction amount, fraud score, timestamps, and computed metrics.
- **Dimension Tables:**  
  - Transaction Dimension, Merchant Dimension, User Dimension, Location Dimension, Card Dimension, ML Signal Dimension, and Policy Dimension.
- **Relationships:**  
  - The fact table references each dimension with surrogate keys.

## Pipeline Details & Orchestration
- **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Extract raw files from the local directory and stage data.
- **Data Enrichment Pipeline:** Join raw data with internal policy data and apply transformation rules.
- **Data Indexing Pipeline:** Merge enriched datasets into unified records.
- **Data Quality Pipeline:** Validate schemas for input and output; log issues.
- **Orchestration:** Airflow continuously schedules and manages each DAG with defined dependencies.

## Deployment & Future Scalability
- **EMR Deployment:**  
  - **Build and Packaging:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline to build Spark job artifacts.  
  - **Cluster Setup:** Deploy a persistent EMR cluster configured via bootstrap scripts.  
  - **Run Strategy:** Airflow jobs execute Spark tasks on the persistent EMR cluster on a continuous schedule.  
  - **Storage Abstraction:** Abstract file paths to seamlessly transition from local storage to S3.
- **Scalability:**  
  - Modular pipelines support independent scaling.  
  - Spark distributed processing handles increased data volumes.

## Metrics & Monitoring
- **Cluster and Job Metrics:** Monitor EMR cluster performance, Spark job statistics, and resource usage with Amazon CloudWatch.
- **Custom Metrics:** Report data quality, throughput, and processing latency directly from Spark jobs.
- **Logging and Alerting:** Use CloudWatch Logs with alerts configured for job failures and performance anomalies.
- **Dashboarding:** Centralize all metrics into a real-time monitoring dashboard.

## Security & Compliance
- **Sensitive Data:** Enforce strict masking for card data and secure access controls.
- **Compliance:** Adhere to applicable data protection regulations and internal security policies.




1. **Real-Time Trade Risk Analytics**  
   - Build a streaming pipeline (e.g., Kafka + Spark/Flink) for ingesting high-throughput trade events across multiple asset classes.  
   - Aggregate position data in real-time to compute intraday risk metrics (VaR, PnL, etc.).  
   - Output data to a data store (e.g., Cassandra or HBase) for dashboards and downstream analytics.

2. **AML & Fraud Detection Pipeline**  
   - Ingest transactions and customer data into a unified data lake (e.g., S3 + Hive/Delta Lake).  
   - Use a distributed ML pipeline (Spark ML or Python-based) to run real-time or batch scoring for suspicious transactions.  
   - Incorporate feedback loops to refine models and integrate with compliance tools for audit and monitoring.

3. **Regulatory Data Lineage & Compliance Platform**  
   - Collect metadata from all ETL/ELT processes, track transformations and data lineage via a centralized governance tool (e.g., Apache Atlas).  
   - Integrate data from multiple sources (trading systems, reference data, logs) for compliance reporting (CCAR, Basel, etc.).  
   - Ensure data quality, auditability, and automatic generation of lineage reports for regulators.
